# umpis

This is Ubuntu MATE post-install script for my personal needs.
Currently it supports Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS.

One can launch this scrupt on freshly installed system using single command below:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N0rbert/umpis/master/umpis.sh -q -O - | sudo -E bash
```
