# umpis

This is Ubuntu MATE (and Debian) post-install script for my personal needs.
Currently it supports Debian 9, 10, 11 and 12; AstraLinux 2.12 and 1.7; Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS.

One can launch this script on freshly installed system using single command below:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N0rbert/umpis/devel/umpis.sh -q -O - | sudo -E bash
```
