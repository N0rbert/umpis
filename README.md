# umpis

This is Ubuntu MATE post-install script for my personal needs. 
Currently it supports only Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS.
This suites my software needs - for example I still need some Python 2 and Qt 4
applications to be installable.

One can launch this scrupt on freshly installed Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS system 
using single command below:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N0rbert/umpis/master/umpis.sh -q -O - | sudo -E bash
```

Later this script may be updated to support Ubuntu MATE 20.04 LTS.
