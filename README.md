# umpis

This is Ubuntu MATE (and Debian) post-install script for my personal needs.
Currently it supports Debian 9, 10, 11 and 12; AstraLinux 2.12 and 1.7; Ubuntu MATE 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS.

One can launch this script on freshly installed system using commands below:

```
cd ~/Downloads
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N0rbert/umpis/master/umpis.sh
chmod +x umpis.sh
sudo -E ./umpis.sh
```
